    <h1>Milanesa Argentina</h1>
    <img alt="Milanesa" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSHJbP8tuD4FUFu8DLfrnPgW3zZeH-97ss6Mg&usqp=CAU">
    <p>Often referred to as Argentina's unofficial national dish, milanesa is a humble, yet delicious meal consisting of a breaded slice of prime beef that is fried in hot oil, curling up as it cooks, due to the fact that the chosen cuts of meat have less fat and sinew than other cuts.

        The dish shares many similarities with the Austrian Wiener schnitzel and the American chicken fried steak. However, milanesa has its roots in Italy, and the original dish has been traced to the city of Milan and the famous cotoletta alla milanese.
        
        Some claim that the best milanesa in Buenos Aires will always be prepared at home, cooked by someone's mother, although many restaurants also have it on their menus. For the pure, basic experience, it is enough to squeeze some lemon juice over it, but it is often served with a side of creamy mashed potatoes or french fries, while one of the most popular varieties is called a caballo (on horseback), where a fried egg is placed on top of the meat.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Breadbrum</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Sunflower Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind the garlic clove and peppercorn in a mortar. If you do not have a mortar, finely chop the garlic and use a pepper grinder for the black peppercorns or ground pepper.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the two eggs lightly and add the garlic and peppercorn mixture. I usually add a Tbsp. of water to the mortar after grinding the garlic and peppercorns, that way it’s easier to add the mix to the eggs. Whisk again.</li>
        <li>In a large dish, spread the bread crumbs mixed with salt (If using regular bread crumbs) and have another dish ready to place the steaks after breading.
        </li>
        <li>Now, to start the breading process. Dip the steaks into the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Using kitchen tongs, place one steak into the crumbs, turn to coat both sides. Patting on lightly to make sure the coating adheres to the steak. If necessary, turn steak again to have an even coating of breadcrumbs. Place the already-breaded steak aside on a plate. I use wax paper to cover the plates for an easy clean up afterward. Repeat this step with the remaining steaks.</li>
        <li>Once you finish breading all the steaks you will proceed to fry them. Using a large skillet, heat ½ inch of oil over medium-high heat. Make sure the oil is hot before placing the steaks. Fry about 3 minutes on each side until golden brown on both sides and cooked through. Place the steaks on paper towels to drain any excess oil before serving.</li>
